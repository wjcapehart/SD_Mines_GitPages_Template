## About these pages

This is a generic download and push set of Gitpages that you can modify.  

This template was originally modified from the classic "RTD" ("Read the Docs") by a former Github developer known as "rundocs".  These pages were discontinued and accounts picked up the others.  [This template uses one mantained by Clear Path Robotics](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/jekyll-rtd-theme), and has been modified with fonts and color schemes more in line with South Dakota Mines' branding policies.

The Instruction Tab to the left will give you guidance applying it and customizing it.

## About _This_ Particular Page

This is your landing page for your copy of this template.  It's the equivalent of the home page. 

Other pages, e.g., "Research," "Academics," "Service," "Etc" can be added using the example in this starter repository with the [*00_Instructions.md*](https://github.com/wjcapehart/SD_Mines_GitPages_Template/blob/main/00%20Instructions.md) file.

Editing and formatting these pages uses the [GitHub Markdown language](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html#).  

```note  
TL;DR: If you have worked with [Jupyter Markdown](https://jupyternotebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) or [RStudio Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html), you will recognize most structures.

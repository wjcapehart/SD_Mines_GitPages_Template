## Making a Web Page on GitPages

Before starting you should first make a generic and blank web page 

Guidence for this is here.  ["Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

Once you get an empty project, you can then populate it.

It also may be helpful to push this tarball to your blank project.

## File Structure

The file structure that you should worry about is:

* /
  * _.config.yml_ (the configuration file - you will need to edit this)
  * __images/_ (a good place to put images)
     * *Department_Lockups_USE_THIS_ONE.png* (copy your prefered "South Dakota Mines 'M' Lockup to this name and it will auto-load when you push it to github.
     * *Department_Lockups_AES_CEE_white_trans.png* (AES/CEE Lockup)
     * *Department_Lockups_CEE_white_trans.png* (CEE Lockup)
  * __includes/_ (localized customizations for nominally compliant South Dakota Mines branding)
     * "If you change these files, it's your recipe and not mine."
  * _assets/css/fonts_ (local fonts sourced in the __includes/_ directories)
  * *LICENSE* (MIT License File)
  * _README.md_ (The Homepage and Introduction for your page.)
     * Any other "md" (markdown) files will arranged on the sidebar in numeric->alphabetical order.

## Editing the _.config.yml_ file.

For the _.config.yml_ make the following changes



## Markdown Files (*.md)

Content (i.e., webpages) are managed through Markdown Files with the (.md) suffix in the root directory of your web project.

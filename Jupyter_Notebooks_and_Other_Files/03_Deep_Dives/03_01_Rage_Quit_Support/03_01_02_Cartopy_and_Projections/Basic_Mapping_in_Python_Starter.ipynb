    "\n",
    "This is a deep dive with a lot of repeative plotting to demonstrate how features are added to a graphical object and the impact each one makes to the entire product.  The goal with this stragegy is that it will let us slowly explore how the more advanced graphics in Python work, albiet at the cost of a much longer Python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this \"Let's Play\" session, we will explore the aspects of plotting graphics beyond the simple way that we've been doing it through the semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for this is that when one goes to the \"online 'help,'\" the examples that are often provided for \"how to make a plot\" for example tends to expect a user to jump in and intuit what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the more abstract concepts of looking at map projections and how they are managed in any kind of software and speaking for me, personally, this is an engraved invitation to rage quit, which I did -- more than once -- when transitioning to Python.  Therefore, in this session we are going to slow-roll the process of working with plots that have maps on them. \n",

    "\n",
    "You can then load the suplemental libraries.  You should only need the cartopy library to get this going, but you will need to install it much like when you load libaries from scipy.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* [Cartopy.features](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/matplotlib/feature_interface.html): The features interface in Cartopy draws a set of pre-prepared geospatial features onto the Axes to where the projection (taken from Cartopy.crs) has been defined.\n",

    "Shapely's job is to manipilate and transform objects in a 2-d cartesian plan.  Cartesian planes in this context are just \"maps.\"  For example, a map will have polygons, lines, etc corresponding to locatoins, borders, coastlines, etc, and later on as we explore, 2-D and 3-D grids.  Typically these will be in a given projection such as Polar Stereographic, or Lambert Conformal Conic, or in terms of latitude and longitude. Shapely bends and warps these fields to fit a projection or to convert projections into latitude and longitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Shapely is about to go through major new release. At the time of me writing this, the current version is 1.8.  The next expected version, 2.0, will have a few major changes from the 1.* editions of Shapely.  Therefore, when running things that will leverages these changes, even if you are not directly using the features, your notebook session will be dripping with so much pink you'll think Strawberry Shortcake killed the Klingon Chancelor with her teeth and claws alone.  I'm trying to limit my use here of Cartopy and Shapely to the bare minium of what we need to plot in this exercise."

This comes as a surprise to a lot of people but in Meteorology, the Mercator projection is often a prefered projection in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) when working in the Tropics since a Mercator Projection is a \"conformal\" projection, meaning that it preserves angles -- i.e., *vectors*.  \n",

So let's redo those flights keeping our domestic flights domestic and that one big one using a more approrate projection such as the [South Polar Stereographic Projection](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/reference/projections.html#cartopy.crs.SouthPolarStereo)!\n",

    "Also since the path will still be long and the projected straight line (on a sphere) looks like a curve in this projection, a careful look at the QA 27 flight path looks like a collection of line segments rather than an smooth curve.  This is because the rendering of lines in projected space are based on a default map projection's distance threshold length -- the longest line it will draw.  We will want small line segment lengths as we draw our circular paths.  \n",

    "To do this, the second plot below illustrates how that can be done:  You must \"clone\" the projection that your MAP is on into a new variable.

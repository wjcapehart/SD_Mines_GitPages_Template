    "# Part 1a: Introduction to Jupyter and Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), a web-based service that allows a user to create both documentation (including equations, links and images), code and its output in a single framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use of Jupyter Notebooks are in increasing use in the science, engineering and technology fields because of their ability to create effective, integrated, sharable, transparent and reproducible reporting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use this Particular Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notebooks for these sessions are self-contained guides to play along.  You would be doing the work and writing the code in your own notebook as well as documenting it with Markdown.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This one is different since it focuses on the Markdown itself which when it's integrated into the notebook, becomes HTML-style text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore for this notebook you should be working with this particular notebook in one window, and an open notebook of your own in another window and \"toggling\" by clicking the mouse over various cells to view the raw Markdown and \"Running\" the cells to see the results."

    "Specific kernels provide support for \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 2 and 3\n",
    "* R\n",

    "The text components of the Markdown are designed to written as HTML print elements.  However, rather than using traditional HTML coding, it uses a different system called [“Markdown”](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) that uses simple plain-text typing to create formatted document text that is a little faster than raw HTML coding.  \n",

You should also try on your own as you absorb the material to write some text in Markdown leveraging some of the elements."

It **_doesn't_** matter if you use ***asterixes*** or ___underscores___ for either bold or italics and indeed as shown here when you toggle, you can just use one of the two choices for both.\n",

## About this Site

This page is a collection of "deep dives" that slowly work through basic issues on spinning up Python for beginners.  It covers the basics of getting started with Python in a Jupyter Notebook and emphasizes things that made me want to rage-quit in my own transition to Python. Consequently, a lot of the material here is slightly cheeky (and sometimes not-so-cheekly).

This differs from a number of tutorial sites and "example" pages out there, as my demos presented here slowly build the activity step-by-step, adding small modifications one element at a time. (In my experience, being flooded with everything at once led to me having to close my door for the benefit of my neighboring colleagues.)


## "Where would Dr Capehart go?"  

If you want to see where I went for my general Python training, here's the place. This presumes a strong comfort with programming in general and some basic Python literacy.

*  [Jake VanderPlas's Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

However, the PDSH does not include mapping, working with XArray, MetPy, or other specialized applications.

For those, I tend to mostly JFGIing it or holding my breath and diving into Stack Overflow.

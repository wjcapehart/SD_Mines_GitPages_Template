# Markdown Tricks

Markdown here works mostly like traditional Markdown in [Jupyter Markdown](https://jupyternotebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) or [RStudio Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)

This presumes that the user understands how to use topic headers, include images, links, and can __bold__, _italicize_, ___etc___ for text.  If not there are examples of these features in the raw markdown on this and other pages in larger template package.

Markdown pages will be "titled" on the sidebar with a single "#" header and do not have the share the same name as the Markdown ".md" file.  Higher-level headers (##, ###, etc) will be then listed in dropdowns on the sidebar menu.

## Equations

Equations follow the LaTeX Markdown format.

As with Jupyter and RStudio, you can use a pair of $'s to wrap inline equationn.  

$$\pi=\int_0^2{ \frac{4}{1+x^2}}dx$$

The [Codecogs's LaTeX Equation Editor](https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php) is a useful tool to graphically construct the markdown code for most equations, as well as learn the basics of LaTeX equations so you can encopde simple equations on your own.

## "Admonitions" & "Toasts"

Not the same as code blocks, these four types of blocks highlight pointers and alarms of various degrees of importance.

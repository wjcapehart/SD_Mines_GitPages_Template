# "Rage-Quit" 'splainers and Deep Dives

## About This Section

This section is dedicated to those who have looked at online documentation and examples and have come out even more confused than they were when they started.  They also cover aspects of Python that I normally don't explicitly cover in classes.   

Also, at the bottom are some deep dives into some applications where I've tried to get fancy with Python.


## The Rage-Quit Zone

You looked at online help and got so frustrated that you wanted to quit Python forever. You had a set of procedures that you always loved to do in another language (e.g., NCL, Gempak, or IDL) that just aren't as easy in Python.  

Well, I was there, too!  In some cases, I have yet to leave.  Hopefully, some of the deep dives, supplementing, for example, the "quick start" materials on Page 2 of this site, will result in less rage, less swearing, and less damage to capital equipment than I've already inflicted on everyone and everything around me!

### Working with fancier elements of matplotlib

This deep dive tries to work through the confusion that can emerge when a plot requires the "Axes" attribute.  This was my first major point of confusion when working with plotting in Python.

## Getting Fancy With Examples
